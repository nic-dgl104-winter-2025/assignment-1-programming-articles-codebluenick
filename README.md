# Developing Cross-Platform Apps with Flutter and React Native

**By Nikhil Chhetri (Student ID - 0205701)**

## Introduction

When I first started exploring mobile app development, I quickly realized how frustrating it was to maintain multiple codebases just to support iOS and Android. Each platform had its own project structure, programming language, and quirks that made development time-consuming. That’s when I discovered **Flutter** (by Google) and **React Native** (by Meta). These frameworks promised a **single codebase** that could deploy to multiple platforms, saving time, effort, and complexity.

In this article, I’ll walk you through the essentials of cross-platform development: setting up a basic app, handling platform-specific functionality, and preparing the app for deployment. I’ll cover **Flutter and React Native**, showcasing how they enable developers to write once and deploy everywhere. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to create cross-platform apps while taking advantage of platform-specific features when needed.

***

## 1. Why Go Cross-Platform?

The biggest advantage of cross-platform frameworks is **efficiency**. Instead of managing separate teams (or codebases) for iOS and Android, developers can write one set of code and deploy it to multiple platforms.

It’s also worth mentioning that both Flutter and React Native come with **robust ecosystems** full of plugins and third-party packages. Whether it’s integrating a camera, handling user authentication, or managing local storage, there are pre-built solutions that simplify the process (Flutter Docs, 2023; React Native Docs, 2023).

Some of the main benefits of cross-platform development include:

- **Faster development cycles** – You write code once and reuse it across platforms.
- **Reduced maintenance costs** – Fewer codebases mean fewer bugs and less effort needed for updates.
- **Consistent user experience** – Apps look and behave similarly across different devices.

***

## 2. Setting Up Your First Cross-Platform App

### 2.1 Flutter “Hello, World!”

Flutter uses **Dart** as its programming language. If you’re new to Dart, don’t worry—it has a syntax similar to Java and JavaScript. To create a new Flutter project, run:

```bash
flutter create my_flutter_app
```

This command generates the necessary project structure. Now, navigate to `lib/main.dart` and replace its contents with:

```dart
// Code Snippet 1: Flutter Basic App
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Hello Flutter',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Hello Flutter'),
        ),
        body: const Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Run the app on an emulator or device with:

```bash
flutter run
```

Flutter also supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, but desktop support might require additional setup (Flutter Docs, 2023).

### 2.2 React Native “Hello, World!”

React Native is JavaScript-based, with support for **TypeScript** as well. To create a new project, run:

```bash
npx react-native init MyReactNativeApp
```

Open `App.js` and replace the contents with:

```javascript
// Code Snippet 2: React Native Basic App
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

To run this app:

```bash
npx react-native run-android  # For Android\ nnpx react-native run-ios      # For iOS
```

Both Flutter and React Native provide a **consistent UI** across platforms, with React Native using native components under the hood.

## 3. Handling Platform-Specific Features

### 3.1 Flutter Platform Channels

Flutter provides **Platform Channels** to communicate with native APIs. Suppose you need to retrieve the device’s battery level. Here’s how you’d set it up on the Dart side:

```dart
// Code Snippet 3: Flutter Platform Channel Dart Side
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

static const platform = MethodChannel('com.example.myapp/battery');

Future<String> getBatteryLevel() async {
  try {
    final int result = await platform.invokeMethod('getBatteryLevel');
    return 'Battery level: $result%';
  } on PlatformException catch (e) {
    return 'Failed to get battery level: ${e.message}';
  }
}
```

### 3.2 React Native Native Modules

React Native uses **Native Modules** to interact with platform-specific features. Below is a simple example of retrieving the battery level on Android using Kotlin:

```kotlin
// Code Snippet 4: React Native Android Native Module (Kotlin)
class BatteryModule(reactContext: ReactApplicationContext)
    : ReactContextBaseJavaModule(reactContext) {

    override fun getName(): String {
        return "BatteryModule"
    }

    @ReactMethod
    fun getBatteryLevel(promise: Promise) {
        try {
            val batteryIntent = reactContext.registerReceiver(
                null,
                IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED)
            )
            val level = batteryIntent?.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_LEVEL, -1) ?: -1
            promise.resolve(level)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            promise.reject("ERROR_BATTERY_LEVEL", e)
        }
    }
}
```

***

## 4. Performance Considerations

Flutter and React Native optimize performance in different ways. Flutter compiles **Dart to native code** and renders everything with its own engine, while React Native uses a bridge to interact with native components (Flutter Docs, 2023; React Native Docs, 2023).

### Performance Tips:
- **Minimize Re-renders in React Native** – Use `React.memo` or `PureComponent`.
- **Use Const Constructors in Flutter** – `const` widgets improve performance.
- **Profile Your App** – Use DevTools (Flutter) or Performance Monitor (React Native).

***

## Conclusion

Cross-platform frameworks like **Flutter** and **React Native** enable faster, more efficient app development by allowing developers to **write once and deploy everywhere**. While each framework has its strengths, both offer a strong ecosystem, high performance, and flexibility for handling platform-specific features. If you’re choosing between the two, it often comes down to whether you prefer **Dart** (Flutter) or **JavaScript** (React Native).

Regardless of which you choose, learning cross-platform development is an **invaluable skill** that makes you a more versatile developer.
